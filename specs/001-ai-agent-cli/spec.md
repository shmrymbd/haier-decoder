# Feature Specification: AI Agent CLI Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-agent-cli`  
**Created**: 2024-12-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add Ai agent to cli code"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Interactive AI Protocol Assistant (Priority: P1)

As a protocol analyst, I want to interact with an AI agent through the CLI to get intelligent assistance with Haier protocol analysis, so that I can quickly understand complex protocol behaviors and get suggestions for analysis approaches.

**Why this priority**: This provides immediate value by making the existing CLI more intelligent and user-friendly, enabling faster protocol analysis and reducing the learning curve for new users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching the CLI with AI agent mode and asking protocol-related questions, verifying that the AI provides relevant and accurate responses about Haier protocol commands and behaviors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user launches the CLI with AI agent mode, **When** they ask "What does command 0x60 do?", **Then** the AI agent responds with detailed explanation of the command's purpose and usage
2. **Given** a user is monitoring live protocol data, **When** they ask "Why is this packet failing CRC validation?", **Then** the AI agent analyzes the packet and provides troubleshooting suggestions
3. **Given** a user wants to understand a complex protocol sequence, **When** they ask "Explain this authentication flow", **Then** the AI agent provides a step-by-step breakdown of the sequence

### User Story 2 - Automated Protocol Analysis (Priority: P2)

As a protocol researcher, I want the AI agent to automatically analyze captured protocol data and provide insights, so that I can discover patterns and anomalies without manual inspection.

**Why this priority**: This extends the value by providing automated analysis capabilities that can process large amounts of data and identify patterns that might be missed by manual inspection.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by feeding captured protocol data to the AI agent and verifying that it identifies patterns, anomalies, and provides meaningful analysis reports.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user provides a log file with protocol data, **When** they request automated analysis, **Then** the AI agent processes the data and generates a comprehensive analysis report
2. **Given** the AI agent is monitoring live data, **When** it detects unusual patterns, **Then** it automatically alerts the user with explanations and potential causes
3. **Given** a user asks for pattern recognition in historical data, **When** the AI agent processes the request, **Then** it identifies recurring patterns and provides statistical summaries

---

### User Story 3 - Intelligent Command Suggestions (Priority: P3)

As a CLI user, I want the AI agent to suggest relevant commands and provide contextual help, so that I can work more efficiently with the Haier protocol tools.

**Why this priority**: This improves user experience by providing intelligent assistance and reducing the need to remember complex command syntax and options.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by using the CLI with AI assistance and verifying that command suggestions are contextually appropriate and helpful.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user types an incomplete command, **When** they request help, **Then** the AI agent suggests completions and explains the command's purpose
2. **Given** a user is working on a specific analysis task, **When** they ask for next steps, **Then** the AI agent suggests relevant commands and analysis approaches
3. **Given** a user encounters an error, **When** they ask for help, **Then** the AI agent provides troubleshooting steps and alternative approaches

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the AI agent is unavailable or fails to respond?
- How does the system handle malformed or incomplete user queries?
- What happens when the AI agent provides incorrect or misleading information?
- How does the system handle sensitive protocol data in AI interactions?
- What happens when the AI agent encounters unknown or encrypted protocol commands?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an AI agent interface accessible through the existing CLI
- **FR-002**: System MUST support natural language queries about Haier protocol commands and behaviors
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to enable/disable AI agent mode via CLI flags
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain conversation context during AI agent sessions
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide automated analysis of captured protocol data
- **FR-006**: System MUST suggest relevant commands based on current context and user intent
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle AI agent failures gracefully without breaking CLI functionality
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve all existing CLI functionality when AI agent is enabled
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear indicators when AI agent is active vs. standard CLI mode
- **FR-010**: System MUST support both interactive and batch modes for AI agent operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **AI Agent Session**: Represents an active AI interaction with conversation history, context, and state
- **Protocol Query**: Represents a user question or request for AI analysis of protocol data
- **Analysis Result**: Represents AI-generated insights, suggestions, or explanations about protocol behavior
- **Command Suggestion**: Represents AI-recommended CLI commands based on current context and user intent

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before feature implementation begins.*

**Protocol-First Development**: Feature must start with protocol analysis and understanding - ✅ AI agent will be trained on existing protocol knowledge
**Security-First Analysis**: All protocol analysis must consider security implications - ✅ AI agent will follow security guidelines for protocol data handling
**Documentation-Driven**: Every protocol component must have corresponding documentation - ✅ AI agent responses will be documented and traceable
**Test-First**: All protocol parsing must have corresponding test vectors - ✅ AI agent will be tested with known protocol scenarios
**CLI Interface**: All tools must expose functionality via CLI - ✅ AI agent will be integrated into existing CLI structure
