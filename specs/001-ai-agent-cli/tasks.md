# Tasks: AI Agent CLI Integration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-ai-agent-cli/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are included as this is a protocol analysis tool requiring validation of AI responses and protocol knowledge accuracy.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before task implementation begins.*

**Protocol-First Development**: All tasks must start with protocol analysis and understanding
**Security-First Analysis**: All protocol analysis tasks must consider security implications  
**Documentation-Driven**: Every protocol component task must include documentation
**Test-First**: All protocol parsing tasks must include test vector creation
**CLI Interface**: All tool tasks must include CLI interface implementation

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project structure as defined in plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create AI Agent directory structure in src/ai/
- [x] T002 Initialize Node.js project with OpenAI API dependency
- [x] T003 [P] Configure Jest testing framework for AI components
- [x] T004 [P] Setup protocol knowledge base structure and test vectors
- [x] T005 [P] Configure CLI interface structure for AI integration

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T006 Setup OpenAI API client and configuration management
- [x] T007 [P] Implement data sanitization framework for protocol data
- [x] T008 [P] Create base AI Agent session management infrastructure
- [x] T009 [P] Setup protocol knowledge base loading and validation
- [x] T010 Configure error handling and logging for AI operations
- [x] T011 Setup environment configuration for AI features
- [x] T012 Create base data models for AI entities (Session, Query, Result, Suggestion)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Interactive AI Protocol Assistant (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to interact with an AI Agent through the CLI to get intelligent assistance with Haier protocol analysis

**Independent Test**: Launch CLI with AI Agent mode, ask "What does command 0x60 do?", verify AI provides detailed explanation of command purpose and usage

### Tests for User Story 1

> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [x] T013 [P] [US1] Unit test for AI Agent interface in tests/ai/agent.test.js
- [x] T014 [P] [US1] Unit test for protocol knowledge base in tests/ai/protocol-knowledge.test.js
- [x] T015 [P] [US1] Integration test for AI conversation flow in tests/integration/ai-conversation.test.js
- [x] T016 [P] [US1] Contract test for AI Agent API in tests/contract/ai-agent-api.test.js

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T017 [P] [US1] Create AI Agent interface in src/ai/agent.js

- [x] T024 [US1] Add logging for AI Agent operations

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Automated Protocol Analysis (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable AI Agent to automatically analyze captured protocol data and provide insights

**Independent Test**: Feed captured protocol data to AI Agent, verify it identifies patterns, anomalies, and provides meaningful analysis reports

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T028 [P] [US2] Create analysis engine in src/ai/analysis-engine.js
- [ ] T029 [US2] Implement automated pattern detection in src/ai/analysis-engine.js

- [ ] T032 [US2] Integrate analysis engine with existing protocol modules
- [ ] T033 [US2] Add analysis result formatting and reporting
- [ ] T034 [US2] Implement analysis result storage and retrieval

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Intelligent Command Suggestions (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable AI Agent to suggest relevant commands and provide contextual help

**Independent Test**: Use CLI with AI assistance, verify command suggestions are contextually appropriate and helpful

### Tests for User Story 3

- [ ] T035 [P] [US3] Unit test for command suggester in tests/ai/command-suggester.test.js
- [ ] T036 [P] [US3] Integration test for command suggestions in tests/integration/command-suggestions.test.js

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for AI Agent interface in tests/ai/agent.test.js"
Task: "Unit test for protocol knowledge base in tests/ai/protocol-knowledge.test.js"
Task: "Integration test for AI conversation flow in tests/integration/ai-conversation.test.js"
Task: "Contract test for AI Agent API in tests/contract/ai-agent-api.test.js"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create AI Agent interface in src/ai/agent.js"
Task: "Create protocol knowledge base in src/ai/protocol-knowledge.js"
Task: "Create conversation manager in src/ai/conversation-manager.js"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
